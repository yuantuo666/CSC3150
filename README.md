## Final Exam Comments

- All questions are short answer questions.
- Focus on the concepts.
- Pesonally I think the slides are hard to understand, it might be better to read the textbook or ChatGPT.
- Assignment * 4: all are pretty practical, and you can refer to the code in the repository.
  - It might be difficult for the first of time, but it really helps when figured out.
  - Plagiarism/fail to compile will lead to 0 marks.
